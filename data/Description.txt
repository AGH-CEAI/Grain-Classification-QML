Description
===========

The dataset contains a total of 288 grain images of three wheat varieties: 
- Canadian, n = 108, 
- Kama, n = 76, 
- Rosa, n = 108.
 
The specialized image processing package GRAINS [1] was used to measure the specific characteristics of each selected grain: kernel area, kernel perimeter, compactness, asymmetry coefficient, kernel length, kernel width, length of kernel groove, germ area, germ length. 

The asymmetry coefficient is the ratio of two quantities: the absolute value of the difference between the areas of the left and right parts of a kernel and the total area of that kernel.

Compactness is a shape descriptor calculated according to the formula C = 4*PI*A/(P*P), where A is the kernel area and P is the kernel perimeter. The maximum value of compactness is equal to one and is taken for a circle. For values close to zero, the shape becomes increasingly elongated.

The file WheatGrainFeatures.xlsx contains the measurements. The unit of measurement is millimetres. The file contains the following variables:

 No. - number,
 Id - name of the wheat grain image,
 wheatvariety - wheat variety (canadian, kama, rosa),
 kernelarea - kernel area, 
 kernelperimeter - kernel perimeter, 
 compactness - compactness, 
 kernellength - kernel length, 
 kernelwidth - kernel width, 
 asymmetry - asymmetry coefficient, 
 groovelength - length of kernel groove, 
 germarea - germ area, 
 germlength - germ length.
